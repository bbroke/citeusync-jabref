citeusync.pl
===========

A simple script to download your bibtex library from citeulike along with your personal PDFs. PDFs are named according to the citeulike record number, and a file{} field is added so that JabRef can locate the files.

Config
------

The script needs a file called .citeusync in your home directory with your login, password, and the path to your PDFs on successive lines. E.g.

	myusername
	mypassword
	/Users/myusername/Documents/Papers
